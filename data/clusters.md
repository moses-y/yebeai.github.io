# Clusters, in prose

> 61 groups covering 167 repositories. Every pair scoring at least 0.68 semantic similarity is an edge, and Louvain modularity over the thresholded semantic edges partitions that graph into groups that are linked more densely inside than out.
>
> **These groupings are INFERRED.** They come from cosine distance between neural embeddings, not from anything measured in a tree. Density is a stronger claim than the connected components this used previously - a bridge repository no longer welds two unrelated neighbourhoods together - but a group of 15 still means 15 closely related projects, not 15 copies of one. Read a large group as a thread to pull, never as a list of duplicates to delete.

## What the numbers say

- 22 of the 61 groups cross a domain boundary. Those are the ones worth reading first: two repositories the classifier put in different parts of the estate that the embedding still pulled together.
- All 167 clustered repositories have been audited, so every keeper below was chosen against a grade rather than against a gap.
- No group is entirely unaudited, so there is no group whose keeper is a guess about a guess.

## How to use this

Each group names a keeper: the highest-graded member, breaking ties on stars and then on size. The rest are candidates for review, not for deletion - the grouping is a guess and the grade behind the keeper may be missing. The machine-readable form is /data/clusters.json. A single repository neighbourhood, including the EXTRACTED shared-dependency edges this report does not cover, is at /data/kin/<id>.json.

## Groups that cross a domain

### c001 - 15 repositories
